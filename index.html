        <h2>Background (Noble)</h2>
        <p>
            Keero is the oldest of two sons of a local landlord. His family has owned land in the region for generations and has rented
            it out to local farmers, businesses, and residents. He was destined for a life of relative ease amond the upper
            middle class of the area and could easily spend the rest of his days attending local socity events and managing
            the afairs of the estate.
        </p>
        <p>
            This vision of the future that his parents so well nurtured bored Keero and he instead wanted adventure. In his swardsmanship
            and archary training, which he was expected to be proficient in even though no one in his family can remember
            when they last to fight or hunt, he dreamed of fighting Kobolds and defending a tower from an onslaught of goblins.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he learned that "Martin's Magnificent Merchants" was in need of recruits he found his chance. He told his friends and
            parents he was going on an adventure with the group to some ruins. "You'll come to your senses", his parents
            exclaimed but let him go nonetheless.
